    <!-- about mobile phone -->
     <h4>
    <p>A mobile phone or cell phone is a portable telephone that allows users to make </p>
    <p> and receive calls over a radio frequency link while moving within a designated </p>
    <p> telephone service area, unlike fixed-location phones (landline phones). </p>
    This radio frequency link connects to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator</p>
     providing access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephony</p>
      relies on a cellular network architecture, which is why mobile phones are often referred to as 'cell phones' in North America. </p>

    <h3>"Mobile phone" is the most common English language term, while the term "cell phone" is in more common use in North America[13]</p> 
        <p>- both are in essence shorter versions of "mobile telephone" and "cellular telephone", respectively. Often in colloquial terms it</p>
 is referred to as simply phone, mobile or cell. A number of alternative words have also been used to describe a mobile phone, most of which</p>
  have fallen out of use, including: "mobile handset", "wireless phone", "mobile terminal", "cellular device", "hand phone", and "pocket phone". </h3>
